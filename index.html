<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help the red-helmetted alien collect all of the acorns he needs to fuel his rocket ship, but don't fall down.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to struggle to control the quick-jumping alien without hitting the floor and losing, being satisfied when they complete the challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is a puzzle/arcade game.  
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can control the alien with the directional arrows on their keyboard.  Left and right arrows move them left and right, the down arrow moves them down, and the up arrow makes them use their anti-gravity helmet to float upwards.  A tally on the top gives a score based on how many acorns the player has collected.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This is evaluating the sound and sprite mechanics, as well as testing the directional movement of the arcade physics in Phaser.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The sound effect used on collecting an acorn is that of a photon torpedo from one of the Star Trek series, giving the animal-like alien's actions a sci-fi feel.  
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game world is abstract, and has no real substance.  
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The unnamed alien struggles to control his anti-gravity helmet as he collects the floating acorns that will allow him to fuel his ship and return home.  He smiles because he is a happy character that enjoys collecting acorns.  As an arcade game there is little tension.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Two minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Tap the up arrow key instead of holding it down.  It is very easy to achieve too much upward thrust.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I borrowed assets from the Phaser tutorial, but recolored the spritesheet because red is a more science-fiction-y color for a helmet.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This most closely resembles the Phaser example.
